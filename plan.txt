this is our plan.


Tasks:
- Mayez + Nikki start coding
- Richard, James, Tara start reading


Before week 9 workshop:
- Some background reading of the literature to establish if there are already ways towards modelling your problem.
- Implement the basic model given to you numerically.
- Can the model treat roads with variable speed limits?
- If so, what does it tell us about the formation of traffic jams in regions where speed limits change?
